Next we look at only those scenarios in which an outbreak occurs and ask how
problem place dynamics affect the size and severity of the outbreak. We consider
Max I – the peak number of infected individuals – and Final R – the total number
individuals infected (and recovered) over the entire course of the outbreak.
Similar to [Extinction Probability Section] we fix a value of R_0, then for
the risk distributions discussed in [Intro Section] we vary the contribution
of problem place spread and observe the effects. This is shown in [Figure 1],
and the results thereof are summarized in [Table 1].
