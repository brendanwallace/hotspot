Outlines the importance of superspreading in disease transmission.
but only looks at individual variation of secondary infectiousness, no
risk-taking or any structure.
brings up the 80/20 rule (80% of infections caused by 20% of the population)

"For outbreaks avoiding stochastic extinction, epidemic growth rates strongly
depend on variation in ν (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). Diseases with
high individual variation show infrequent but explosive epidemics after
introduction of a single case. This pattern recalls SARS in 2003, for which
many settings experienced no epidemic despite unprotected exposure to SARS
cases27,28, whereas a few cities suffered explosive outbreaks8,9,10,15,26. Our
results, using k̂ = 0.16 for SARS, explain this simply by the presence or
absence of high-ν individuals in the early generations of each outbreak6. In
contrast, conventional models (with k = 1 or k → ∞) cannot simultaneously
generate frequent failed invasions and rapid growth rates without additional,
subjective model structure."

Very specific model of COVID-19 as it spreads in CBGs and POIs.
Uses fine-grained mobility data to model a disease outbreak concentrated at points 
of interest (POIs).
Mobility from census block groups (CBGs)

Shows that decreased mobility has a relationship with reduced case growth
of COVID-19 (uses phone data in the USA).

SEIR model, relatively realistic that overlays actual mobility information
between blocks of people 600-3000 in size to POI (points of interest).
