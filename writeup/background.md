[superspreading_2005] 

Outlines the importance of superspreading in disease transmission.
but only looks at individual variation of secondary infectiousness, no risk-taking
or any structure.
brings up the 80/20 rule (80% of infections caused by 20% of the population)

"For outbreaks avoiding stochastic extinction, epidemic growth rates strongly depend on variation in ν (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). Diseases with high individual variation show infrequent but explosive epidemics after introduction of a single case. This pattern recalls SARS in 2003, for which many settings experienced no epidemic despite unprotected exposure to SARS cases27,28, whereas a few cities suffered explosive outbreaks8,9,10,15,26. Our results, using k̂ = 0.16 for SARS, explain this simply by the presence or absence of high-ν individuals in the early generations of each outbreak6. In contrast, conventional models (with k = 1 or k → ∞) cannot simultaneously generate frequent failed invasions and rapid growth rates without additional, subjective model structure."
