1. Intro to SIR model => Probabilistic


2. Explain how my model works (in particular, the non-homogeneity, distributions of pr)


3. Explain terms: R0; R0c & R0r

[basic SIR, what to look for]


4. Introduce results, explain the messiness, explain how they're synchronized by
peak number of infected people.

[picture 1: a ton of curves]
[peak infection times]

5. results 1:

[pandemic shapes – just number of infected individuals]
	– high variance, low variance; high R0, low R0

Blown-over shape!

6. results 2:

distribution shapes

R0=2 [3 pictures]

R0=8 [3 pictures]


When p_r is concentrated in a small number of people, it's hard to realize
the latent potential: an expected infection is not an infection.

7. results 3:

[histograms of the infection sizes]

8. results 4:


Risky people are infected earlier –
[chance of getting infected] + [the heat map thing] in uniform case with R0 = 8
you can see that the riskyness of taking risky action isn't really changing,
but the riskyness of people getting infected is changing (this pattern is present
in all of them, but clearest with uniform)


9. Next steps


Branching theory, chance of extinction, SSEs
explicit relationship between the variance and the infection size?
differential equation model with the distribution of p_r as part of it?


10. Architecture
